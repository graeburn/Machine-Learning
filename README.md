# Machine Learning Course Notes

Jupyter notebook lab code solutions for the Machine Learning module MTH786.

The courseworks implement the following techniques:
* Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent.
* LASSO regularization using Proximal Gradient Descent.
* Nearest Neighbour Classification.
* A final project applying Multinomal Logistic Regression to compare the accuracy of classifying the digits of the MNIST dataset using all of the previous approaches as follows:
1. Logistic Regression.
2. Logistic Ridge Regression.
3. LASSO Logistic Regression.
4. LASSO Coordinate Descent.
5. K-Nearest Neighbour.
